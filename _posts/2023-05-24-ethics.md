Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming every aspect of our lives, from health care to entertainment, from education to transportation. But as AI becomes more powerful and ubiquitous, it also raises ethical questions and challenges. How can we ensure that AI is fair, transparent, accountable, and respectful of human dignity and rights? How can we prevent AI from being misused for malicious purposes or amplifying existing biases and inequalities? How can we foster public trust and engagement in AI development and governance?

These are some of the questions that AI ethics aims to address, by applying ethical principles and values to the design, deployment, and regulation of AI systems. AI ethics is not a niche topic for philosophers or computer scientists; it is a matter of concern for everyone who uses or is affected by AI, which is practically everyone in today's world. Yet, despite its importance and relevance, AI ethics does not seem to attract much attention or interest from the general public.

According to a recent survey by the World Economic Forum, only 41% of people around the world said they care about the ethical implications of AI. The survey also found that people are more likely to trust human experts than AI agents, even if the latter are more accurate or reliable. This suggests that people are not fully aware of or comfortable with the potential benefits and risks of AI, and that they may have a low level of confidence in the ability of AI developers and regulators to address ethical issues.

One possible reason for this lack of public interest and trust in AI ethics is that it is often presented as a technical or abstract topic, with little connection to people's everyday experiences and values. Many people may not realize how AI affects their lives, or how their choices and actions can shape the development and use of AI. Moreover, many people may feel powerless or excluded from the decision-making processes that determine the ethical norms and standards for AI.

To change this situation, we need to make AI ethics more accessible and engaging for everyone. We need to raise awareness of the ethical implications of AI, and empower people to participate in the ethical design and governance of AI. Here are some possible ways to achieve this:

- Use storytelling and narratives to illustrate the ethical dilemmas and trade-offs that arise from AI applications in various domains and contexts. For example, show how AI can help or harm people in health care, education, justice, or security scenarios.
- Provide clear and concise explanations of the ethical principles and values that guide the development and use of AI, such as fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy, or human dignity. For example, explain what these principles mean in practice, why they are important, and how they can be implemented or measured.
- Create interactive and immersive platforms that allow people to experience the benefits and risks of AI first-hand, and to express their opinions and preferences. For example, use games, simulations, or virtual reality to let people interact with different types of AI agents, systems, or scenarios.
- Involve diverse stakeholders and perspectives in the ethical deliberation and decision-making processes for AI. For example, use participatory methods such as surveys, focus groups, workshops, or online forums to solicit input and feedback from different groups of users, experts, or affected parties.
- Establish trust mechanisms that ensure the accountability and transparency of AI developers and regulators. For example, use audits, certifications, standards, or codes of conduct to monitor and evaluate the ethical performance and compliance of AI systems.

AI ethics is not only a matter of technical expertise or regulation; it is also a matter of public education and engagement. By making AI ethics more relevant and appealing for everyone, we can foster a more informed and responsible use of AI, and a more inclusive and democratic governance of its ethical implications.
